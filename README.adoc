This is an opinionated EDN to/from JSON converter.

The functionality provided by this library makes an effort to support conversion between
EDN to JSON and back without losing data (as much as possible).

== Motivation

While working with ClojureScript immutable data sources is great inside Clojure land, most
of the Javascript Ecosystem is designed and optimized to work around JSON. For example,
if you want store data in the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API[IndexedDB]
on the browser, the documents that you store must be JSON objects.

You could try to go around this by having a object with a single key that has the EDN
encoded as string (or maybe transit?), but if you do so, you can't leverage the IndexedDB
indexes, that expect json structures to work upon.

There is the standard `clj->js`, but it has some problems:

- it loses keyword namespaces data
- types are constrained by JSON (loses type information for UUID's, dates, etc...)

This library tries to address this problem by making an opinionated encoder/decoder, by
taking some arbitrary decisions (and sticking to them) we can send and recover this data.

== Encoding decisions

Since JSON is not as rich or extensible as EDN, some decisions have to be made to enable
the reconstruction of the original EDN data from the JSON encoded one.

The decisions taken by this library focus on the following properties:

- Scalar shared types must be transparent (encode and decode as-is)
- Nested structures should be reflected as JSON
- Support encoding of different sequence types sets, lists and vectors
- Support map keys as strings, keywords, symbols, maps, sets and vectors
- Since most map keys are keywords, this library assumes that JSON keys starting with `:` are keywords

NOTE: that last point means that if you encode `{":string" 42}`, that key string is going
to be decoded as a keyword instead of a string. Considering JSON strings starting with
`:` are quite rare, this is a trade off this library is willing to take.

== What it looks like?

Some examples of data encoded using this library:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-ns
  (:require [com.wsscode.edn<->json :refer [edn->json json->edn]))

; simple scalars
(= (edn->json 42) 42)
(= (edn->json true) true)
(= (edn->json nil) null)
(= (edn->json "string") "string")

; edn scalars
(= (edn->json :keyword) "__edn-value|:keyword")
(= (edn->json :ns/keyword) "__edn-value|:ns/keyword")
(= (edn->json 'symb) "__edn-value|symb")
(= (edn->json 'foo/symb) "__edn-value|foo/symb")

; edn default extensions
(= (edn->json #uuid "") "__edn-value|#uuid foo/symb")
(= (edn->json #inst"2020-01-08T03:20:26.984-00:00") "__edn-value|#inst \"2020-01-08T03:20:26.984-00:00\"")

; sequences
(= (edn->json []) #js [])
(= (edn->json [42]) #js [42])
(= (edn->json #{true}) #js ["__edn-list-type|set" true])
(= (edn->json '(nil :kw)) #js ["__edn-list-type|list" null "__edn-value|:kw"])

; maps
(= (edn->json {}) #js {})
(= (edn->json {2 42}) #js {"2" 42})
(= (edn->json {nil 42}) #js {"__edn-key:nil" 42})
(= (edn->json {true 42}) #js {"__edn-key:true" 42})
(= (edn->json {"foo" 42}) #js {"foo" 42})
(= (edn->json {:foo 42}) #js {":foo" 42})
(= (edn->json {:foo/bar 42}) #js {":foo/bar" 42})
(= (edn->json {:foo {:bar 42}}) #js {":foo" #js {":bar" 42}})

; maps with complex keys
(= (edn->json {'sym 42}) #js {"__edn-key:sym" 42})
(= (edn->json {[3 5] 42}) #js {"__edn-key:[3 5]" 42})
(= (edn->json {#{:a :c} 42}) #js {"__edn-key:#{:a :c}" 42})
----

To decode, use the `json->edn` function:

[source,clojure]
----
(json->edn #js {":foo" #js {":bar" 42}}) ; => {:foo {:bar 42}}
----

IMPORTANT: numbers are not going to be restored with json->edn, instead
their string counterpart will be used, this is trade off made this way to keep sane
number keys on the JSON side.

== When to use this library

Don't use this library for transport layers. Unless your transport layer can do some
sort of optimization on top JSON structures, you are better using Transit directly.
Note that Transit produces JSON suitable for faithful round-trips in and out of EDN
types, but itâ€™s not good for consuming as JSON.

This library gives up some round-tripability to get something that a native JSON
environment could consume comfortably, e.g. storing EDN as JSON in stores that can
take advantage of the JSON structure to function/optimize. Most cases will be around
document stores (IndexedDB, Mongo, PouchDB, etc...).
